## Project Description

Satellite tracker uses the https://api.cfast.dev/satellite API to track the health and altitude of the CarsFast satellite. It updates every 10 seconds and displays the information in real time to observe the altitude data of the satellite and gives a status update depending on the altitude and how safely the satellite is keeping its relative height to maintain its orbit.

## Features

- Displays the Min/Max/Avg altitude of the satellite.
- Displays a status bar for easy monitoring of overall orbital health.
- Updates in real-time every 10 seconds.
- Maintains 5 minutes of past data, then removes oldest point of data.

### Installation

Guide users through the installation process step by step.

1. Download the code from repository.
2. Create a clone in coding environment.
3. Run npm install for dependancies.

## Usage

There are 2 primary commands to use this application -
